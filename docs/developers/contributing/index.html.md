## Reporting issues like a pro

First, check for duplicates by searching on GitHub. All clear? Then make sure you cover three points:

*  A concise description of the problem. If the issue is a fatal error, include a debug trace. Otherwise, describe the behavior you were expecting to see, along with the behavior you actually observed.

* A reproducible test case. If you need to include a lot of code to do this, make a gist on GitHub and link it.

* Include the precise Vanilla version number and any relevant system information (ex: OS, PHP version & settings, MySQL settings).

## Triaging issues

There are a number of things you can do to help triage issues in the issue tracker.

* Reproduce it! For a bug to be actionable, it needs to be reproducible. If you canâ€™t reproduce the bug, try to figure out why. Get in touch with the submitter if you need more information.

* Reduce bugs. Once a bug can be reproduced, reduce it to the smallest amount of code possible. Reasoning about a sample that reproduces a bug in just a few lines of Swift code is easier than reasoning about a longer sample.

* Eliminate duplicates. If two bug reports refer to the same underlying problem, mark the newer one as a duplicate of the older one. Doing so allows others to work more effectively.
