## Reporting issues like a pro

First, check for duplicates by searching on GitHub. All clear? Then make sure you cover three points:

*  A concise description of the problem. If the issue is a fatal error, include a debug trace. Otherwise, describe the behavior you were expecting to see, along with the behavior you actually observed.

* A reproducible test case. If you need to include a lot of code to do this, make a gist on GitHub and link it.

* Include the precise Vanilla version number and any relevant system information (ex: OS, PHP version & settings, MySQL settings).
